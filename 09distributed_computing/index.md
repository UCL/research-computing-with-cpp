title: "Week 9: Distributed Memory Parallelism"
---

## Week 9: Overview 

This week we'll introduce the basic model of distributed memory parallelism. We'll see how it differs from the shared memory model that we looked at last week, as well as how to combine the two to solve problems. We'll also take a look at how to combine our understanding of parallel programming with single threaded performance programming to yield better results. We'll then take a very basic loop how to use MPI to write a simple C++ program for distributed systems.
