### This Week

This week we will look the role of pointers in C++, and some of the different options we have for defining and using them. We'll revisit class design and polymorphism which are greatly enhanced by the functionality of pointers. We'll also discuss templates, sometimes referred to as _compile time polymorphism_, and compare this with the _run-time polymorphism_ that we've already met. 

* [Pointers](./sec01Pointers.html)
    - Smart pointers 
    - Data ownership and memory management
    - Raw pointers
* [Templates](./sec03Templates)
    - Function templates
    - Class templates
    - Operator & function overloading
    - Compiling templated code
