### This Week

This week we will continue to explore object oriented programming, delving into design considerations when writing classes for our programs. We'll also look an another method for writing flexible and re-usable code in C++ called _generic programming_ with templates. 

* [Designing Classes](./sec01DesigningClasses.md)
    - Properties of high quality code
    - Guiding principles 
    - Applications of abstract classes
* [Templates](./sec02Templates.md) 
    - Class templates
    - Function templates
    - Function overloading 
    - Compiling templated code
