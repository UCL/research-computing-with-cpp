title: "Week 4: Polymorphism"
---

### This Week

This week we will look at, compare, and contrast two approaches to polymorphism in C++. We'll look at **runtime polymorphism**, also known as **dynamic polymorphism**, through the use of _inheritance_ to define sub-types with special behaviours. We'll also discuss **compile-time polymorphism**, also known as **static polymorphism**, through the use of _templates_ (and sometimes therefore referred to as _template meta-programming_) to define generic code which compiler can use to automatically generate specialised code for different types.

* [Inheritance](./sec01Inheritance.html)
    - Creating sub-types using inheritance
    - Overriding functions
    - Runtime polymorphism with virtual functions
    - Abstract classes for interfaces
* [Templates](./sec03Templates.html)
    - Function templates
    - Class templates
    - Operator & function overloading
    - Compiling templated code
* [Variadic Templates](./sec04VariadicTemplates.html)
    - Variadic templates and functions
    - Fold expressions
    - Recursive variadic functions
