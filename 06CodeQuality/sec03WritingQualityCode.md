## Writing Quality Code

> Programs are meant to be read by humans and only incidentally for computers to execute

If you leave this lesson with only the above quote from [Donald Knuth][wiki-dk] burned into your brain, I'll be happy. This section is about encouraging you to think about how you write C++ in a readable way. The more readable your code is, the easier it it to spot mistakes, add features, and generally maintain. Let's start with some truly terrible code (courtesy of Katrina Ward from Missouri University of Science and Technology):

``` cpp
// Kat                                                               

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main()
{
  char mlevel;              // this is a valid char                   
  bool chalmers;
  string name;
  double r, g, c, peoplewhoareadults;                                            
                cout << "Hi" << endl;
				cin >> name >> endl;
		cin >> r >> endl;                                            
		cin >> g >> endl;
		cin >> c >> endl;
		cin >> peoplewhoareadults >> endl;
		cin >> chalmers >> endl;
  cout << "What is your motivation?\n"
       << " a. Amazingly Motivated\n"
	   << " b. Basicly a good worker\n"
	   << " c. Can't get good help no more\n"
	   << " d. Don't plan on work from me\n"
	   << " e. Elevated Slothfullness \n\n"
	   << "Enter the letter of your choice: ";
	   cin >> mlevel;
	   
	   if(mlevel=='a')   // this is an if statement
	   {
	   if(r>=0.5)
	   {
	   if(g<=5)    // checks if g <= 5
	   {
	   cout << "burn books" << endl;
	   }
	   else
	   {
	   cout << "clean the bathroom" << endl;
	   }
	   }
	   else
	   {
	   if(g<=5)
	   {
	   cout << "Go get more g" << endl;
	   }
	   else if(g>=5 && g<10)
	   {
	   cout << "Mow grass" << endl;
	   }
	   else
	   cout << "Do laps in the tractor" << endl;
	   }
	   // This is a comment right in the middle that says I stayed up too late and didn't do my homework
	   // and now my code looks horrible. Large paragraphs of comments makes your code harder to read
	   // try using short statements to briefly explain what a block of code is actually doing instead
	   // of paragraphs that state nothing really important.
	   }
	   else if(mlevel=='b')
	   {
	            if(chalmers==1||peoplewhoareadults>c)
		{
		    cout << "Scrub floors on hands and knees" << endl;
			}
			   else
			   {
			   cout << "Mop the floor." << endl;
			                    }
						}
		else if(mlevel=='c')
		{
		if(r<=1.5)
		{
		                         cout << "Lean on rake." << endl;
								 }
					else
					     cout << "Lean on broom inside" << end;
		}
		else if(mlevel=='e')
		{
		  cout << "Stay in bed" << endl;
		}
		
		return 0;
	}
			   
```

### Exercise

Read the above code and write down a list of **five** things you'd recommend to Kat to improve her code. This could include:

- how comments are used
- variable names
- formatting
- software design (or lack of!)

### Exercise

Read [J. B. Rainsberger's *The Four Elements of Simple Design*][four-elements] and answer the following questions. Keep your answers handy; we'll be discussing this on Friday.

- Do you agree with his 4 elements? What about the 2 elements he ends up with? Why?
- J codes in an iterative way, renaming functions to `foo` before he knows what they *really* do. How could this impact collaboration if J is writing functions called `foo`?
- What is the value in this kind of iterative programming?
- What are the potential downsides?
- How would you use J's iterative programming style to improve Kat's code from the previous exercise?
