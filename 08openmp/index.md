title: "Week 8: Parallel Programming with OpenMP"
---

## Week 8: Overview

This week we'll be focusing on speeding up our code by taking advantage of **parallelism**, i.e. splitting up a problem and giving different pieces to different processors. In these notes we'll introduce the following concepts:

- [What is parallel programming?](01_parallel_programming.html)
  - Why do we need parallel programming?
  - What are shared- and distributed-memory parallelism?
  - What are weak and strong scaling?
- [An introduction to OpenMP](02_intro_openmp.html)
  - Parallelising loops
  - Reductions
  - Data sharing
  - Thread control
  - Schedules
  - Parallelising nested loops
- [OpenMP example: Fractals](03_fractal_example.html)
- [Cache Performance in Shared Memory](04_cache_performance.html)
- [Summary](05_summary.html)
