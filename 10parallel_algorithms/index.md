## Week 10: Overview 

This week we'll take a deeper look at how we quantify how parallelisable algorithms are, and discuss some broad strategies for tacking parallel problems. These approaches apply to both shared and dsitributed memory systems. We'll also look at how to program with MPI for asynchronous computations - those in which the processes do not necessarily run in lock-step with one another.
