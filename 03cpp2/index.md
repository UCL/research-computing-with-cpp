## Week 3: Overview 

### This Week

This week we'll be looking at how to work with larger and more complex C++ projects. We'll cover approaches to error handling in C++, including _exceptions_, how to manage building significant projects using C++ and work with an external library, and how to test our code rigorously. 

* [Exceptions](./sec01Exceptions.html)
    - Error handling basics
    - Exception types
    - Try and Catch statements
    - Defining our own Exception types
* [Other Error Handling Mechanisms](./sec02ErrorHandling.html)
    - Error return codes
    - Optional types
* [CMake for C++ Projects](./sec03CMake.html)
    - Basics of CMake files
    - Project directory structure
    - Setting C++ standards
    - Finding and linking to libraries
* [Unit Testing](./sec04UnitTesting.html)
    - Installing the Catch2 testing library
    - Testing Strategy
    - Writing tests
