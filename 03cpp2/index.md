## Week 3: Overview 

### This Week

This week will focus on introducing object oriented techniques in the context of C++. We will look at how we can use classes in our programs to group data and functionality together, and how we can create relationships between classes using inheritance or composition to make more interesting and flexible objects. We'll then look at error handling in C++ using exceptions, which will also make use of our knowledge of inheritance.
