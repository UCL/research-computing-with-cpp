## Why use Libraries?

### What are libraries?

* Libraries provide collections of useful classes and functions, ready to use
* C++ libraries can be somewhat harder to use than pure Python modules
* This lecture will get you started

### Libraries from a Scientific Coding perspective

* You want to Explain your science
    * Should not just distribute binaries and papers with the "final" product
    * Source code is best description of your science (it shows all the step you've followed)
* Reproducible science
    * Collaborators must know how you build your project and libraries
    * Others can reproduce your results and build on top of it
* Time is short
    * Don't re-invent the wheel
    * Use libraries if they provide bits you need
