## Why use Libraries?

> The best code is the code you never write

### What are libraries?

- Libraries are collections of useful classes and functions, ready to use
- C++ libraries can be somewhat harder to use than modules in other languages (e.g. Python)
- Can save time and effort by providing well-tested, flexible, optimised features

### Libraries from a scientific coding perspective

Libraries help us do science faster

- Write less code (probably)
- Write better tested code (probably)
- Write faster code (possibly)

Particular things we scientists don't ever want to build ourselves:

- standard data structures (e.g. arrays, trees, linked lists, etc)
- file input/output (both for config files and output files)
- standard numerical algorithms (e.g. sorting, linear solve, FFT, etc)
- data analysis and plotting

Sometimes we have to build things ourselves, when:

- a library isn't fast enough
- we don't trust a library's results/methods
- a library doesn't provide the needed functionality
- we can't use a library due to licensing issues
