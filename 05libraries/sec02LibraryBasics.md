## Library Basics

### Reviewing the build process

When building an application there are three important steps:

- **preprocessing**: follow the directives (lines started by `#`) on the files to combine the units into what's passed to the compiler;
- **compilation**: translates the program into machine language code - object files;  and
- **linking**: merges the various object files and links all the referred libraries as needed to create the executable.

Though normally these steps are invoked by a single command, you can run them one at a time.

- preprocessor:

  ```bash
  g++ -E -o <output> <input.cpp>
  ```
- compilation:

  ```bash
  g++ -c -o <output.o> <input.cpp>
  ```
- linking:

  ```bash
  g++ -o <executable> <output.o>
  ```

Directly using the compiler without a build tool (e.g., [CMake][lesson-cmake]) will eventually become too difficult and cause a mess.


Find more details of these steps on the following resources:

- [The C Preprocessor][CppAdv6] chapter on the [C++: Advanced Topics][CppAdv] course.
- How the C++ [Compiler][CppChernoCompiler] and [Linker][CppChernoLinker] works videos by [The Cherno][Cherno].

### Including libraries

You need your compiler to find:

* Headers: `#include`
* Libraries:
    * Dynamic: `.dylib` (mac), `.so` (linux), `.lib` / `.dll` (windows)
    * Static: `.a` (*nix), `.lib` (windows)

We will see the [differences between dynamic and static libraries][lesson-DynVsSt] in the next page.
Let's see first how we include the libraries to our programme.

### In practice

Normally, when including with `<>` the preprocessor looks for headers in the include path list.
You can specify the include folder(s) by using the `-I` argument as needed.
Similarly, the `-L` argument is used to give the path in which the linker should search for libraries to link,
and the `-l` flag gives the name of the library to be linked. Note that the libraries files always start with `lib`
but we don't add such prefix when referring to it.

For example:

```bash
# compilation
g++ -c -I /users/me/myproject/include main.cpp
# linking
g++ -o main main.o -L /users/me/myproject/lib -l mylib
```

#### Check Native Build Platform

* Look inside
    * Makefile
    * Visual Studio options
* Basically constructing `-I`, `-L`, `-l` switches to pass to command line compiler.


#### Windows Compiler Switches

* Visual Studio (check version)
* Project Properties
    * C/C++ -> Additional Include Directories.
    * Configuration Properties -> Linker -> Additional Library Directories
    * Linker -> Input -> Additional Dependencies.
* Check compile line - its equivalent to Linux/Mac, `-I`, `-L`, `-l`


### Location Issues

When you use a library, keep in mind the following questions:

* Where is it? (do we need to set `I` and `L` when compiling?)
* Is it a [Header only][header-only-wiki]?
* System's version or your version?
* What about bugs? How do I upgrade? Do I need to build it myself?


### Compilation Issues

Also, there are some issues related with the compilation:

* Which library version?
* Which compiler version?
* Debug or Release?
* [Static or Dynamic][learncpp-static-dynamic]?
* 32 bit / 64 bit?
* Platform specific flags?
* Pre-installed, or did you compile it?


### A Few Good Libraries

Due to all those issues shown above, again, the main advice for libraries:

* As few as possible
* As good as possible
