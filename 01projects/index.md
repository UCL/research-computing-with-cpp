## Contents

This week we will introduce you to the basics of writing, compiling, and running a program using C++. We will go through most things for this class with live demonstrations, but you may find it helpful to read over the notes ahead of class anyway, and you can refer back to them throughout the course. 

In this section we also provide notes on how to use **git** if you have not done so before. Git is a version control system that we will use throughout the course and for your coursework assignments, so be sure to read this through.
