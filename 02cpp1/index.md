## Lecture 2: Overview 

### The Story So Far

* Git
* CMake

### Todays Lesson

Today we'll be covering come core features of the C++ language, in particular aspects of the standard library. We won't be covering the very basics of the language, so if you are unfamiliar with things like variables, loops, and functions in C++ you should look at some introductory C++ material first (for example the LinkedIn Learning course recommended in the Moodle). 

This week will cover:
* [Common Standard Library Features](./sec01StandardLibrary.md)
    - Input / Output
    - Containers & Iterators 
    - Algorithms & Anonymous Functions
    - Understanding C++ Documentation
* [Passing by Value and by Reference](./sec02PassByValueOrReference.md)
    - Differences between passing arguments to functions by value and by reference
    - Usage of the `const` keyword
* [Pointers](./sec03Pointers.md)
    - Memory in C++ 
    - Data ownership models 
    - Smart pointers for data ownership
    - Raw pointers
